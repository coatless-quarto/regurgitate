## Introduction

This document demonstrates the `regurgitate` extension with language grouping enabled, e.g. `group-by-language: true`. Code blocks will be organized by programming language at the end.

## Python Example

Here's some Python code:

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
    
hello()
```

## Data Analysis

Let's do some calculations:

```{r}
# R code
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(data)
```

## Shell Commands

Some bash commands:

```bash
echo "Building project..."
make clean
make all
```

## More Python

Another Python snippet:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(arr.mean())
```

## JavaScript Example

A quick JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Conclusion

With `group-by-language: true`, all code blocks are grouped by language in the Code Appendix. Languages appear in alphabetical order with subsection headers.

Since `show-code-inline: true` (the default), code blocks remain in their original positions above and are also copied to the appendix.
