## Introduction

This document demonstrates `show-output-results: false`, which includes only code in the appendix without execution results.

This is useful when you want readers to see output inline but have a clean code reference at the end.

## Python Example

Let's do some calculations:

```{python}
print("Hello from Python!")
result = 2 + 2
print(f"2 + 2 = {result}")
```

The output appears above inline, but won't be repeated in the appendix.

## R Example

Some R calculations:

```{r}
# Create a vector
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(paste("Sum:", sum(numbers)))
print(paste("Mean:", mean(numbers)))
```

## Conclusion

In the Code Appendix at the end, you'll see:

- All code blocks grouped by language
- No execution results/output (because `show-output-results: false`)

This creates a cleaner code reference while keeping output visible inline for understanding.
