## Introduction

This document demonstrates how the `regurgitate` extension handles code execution results. 

With `show-output-results: true` (the default), both code and its output are copied to the appendix.

## Python Example

Let's do some calculations:

```{python}
print("Hello from Python!")
result = 2 + 2
print(f"2 + 2 = {result}")
```

## R Example

Some R calculations:

```{r}
# Create a vector
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(paste("Sum:", sum(numbers)))
print(paste("Mean:", mean(numbers)))

plot(numbers)
```

## Conclusion

Notice that in the Code Appendix at the end:

- Code blocks are shown
- Output/results from code execution are also shown (because `show-output-results: true`)

To see only code without results in the appendix, set `show-output-results: false`.
