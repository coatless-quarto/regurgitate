# General Information

## What is the regurgitate extension for Quarto?

The `regurgitate` extension for Quarto is a filter that automatically collects all code blocks from your document and places them in a "Code Appendix" at the end. It provides flexible options for organizing code by programming language, controlling whether code appears inline, and managing execution results.

## Why would I use the regurgitate extension?

The regurgitate extension is useful when you want to:

- Provide a complete code reference at the end of your document
- Allow readers to see examples in context while having easy access to all code
- Create clean narratives by moving code to an appendix
- Organize multi-language tutorials with language-specific sections
- Generate copy-pasteable code snippets separate from output

# Installation

## How do I install the regurgitate extension?

To install the extension in your Quarto project:

```bash
quarto add coatless-quarto/regurgitate
```

Or manually copy the `_extensions/regurgitate` folder into your project's `_extensions` directory.

Your project structure should include:

```bash
your-project/
├── _extensions/
│   └── coatless-quarto/
│       └── regurgitate/
│           ├── _extension.yml
│           └── regurgitate.lua
└── your-document.qmd
```

## Is the regurgitate extension compatible with all Quarto versions?

The `regurgitate` extension requires Quarto v1.7.0 or later. It has been tested with both standalone code blocks and Quarto executable cells (Python, R, etc.).

# Configuration

## What configuration options are available?

The regurgitate extension provides four configuration options:

```yaml
extensions:
  regurgitate:
    group-by-language: false      # Organize by language
    show-code-inline: true        # Show code inline
    show-output-results: true     # Include execution results
    debug: false                  # Enable debug logging
```

## How do I enable the extension in my document?

Add the filter to your document's YAML header:

```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
format: html
filters:
  - regurgitate
---
```

This will use all default settings and create a code appendix at the end.

## What does the group-by-language option do?

When `group-by-language: true`, code blocks in the appendix are organized by programming language with subsection headers:

```yaml
extensions:
  regurgitate:
    group-by-language: true
```

Your appendix will have sections like:

```markdown
# Code Appendix

## Python
[Python code blocks]

## R
[R code blocks]

## JavaScript
[JavaScript code blocks]
```

## What does show-code-inline control?

The `show-code-inline` option controls whether code remains in its original position:

- `true` (default): Code appears both inline and in the appendix
- `false`: Code is removed from inline positions and only appears in the appendix

```yaml
extensions:
  regurgitate:
    show-code-inline: false  # Clean narrative, code only at end
```

## What does show-output-results do?

The `show-output-results` option controls whether code execution results are included in the appendix:

- `true` (default): Results are copied to the appendix with code
- `false`: Only code appears in the appendix (no output)

```yaml
extensions:
  regurgitate:
    show-output-results: false  # Clean code snippets only
```

This is useful when you want readers to see what code does inline, but have clean, copy-pasteable code at the end.

# Usage

## How do I create a code appendix?

Just add the filter to your YAML header:

````markdown
---
title: "Tutorial"
format: html
filters:
  - regurgitate
---

## Example

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

More content here...
````

A "Code Appendix" section will automatically appear at the end with all code blocks.

## Can I use this with Quarto executable cells?

Yes! The extension works with both standalone code blocks and Quarto executable cells:

````markdown
---
title: "Data Analysis"
format: html
filters:
  - regurgitate
---

```{{python}}
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(data.head())
```
````

Both the code and its output will be collected.

## How do I create an organized multi-language appendix?

Use `group-by-language: true` to organize code by language:

```yaml
---
title: "Web Development Tutorial"
format: html
filters:
  - regurgitate
extensions:
  regurgitate:
    group-by-language: true
---
```

Your appendix will have separate sections for R, Python, Julia, etc.

## What if my cell has multiple code chunks?

The extension handles cells with multiple code chunks correctly. Each chunk and its results are collected:

```{{python}}
print("First chunk")

print("Second chunk")
```

Both chunks will appear in the appendix.

## Can I use this extension with other filters?

Yes! The regurgitate extension works alongside other Quarto filters. Just list them in order:

```yaml
filters:
  - other-filter
  - regurgitate
  - another-filter
```

The order may matter depending on what each filter does.

## Does this work with all output formats?

The extension is designed for HTML output formats. While it may work with other formats, it's primarily tested with:

- `html`
- `revealjs` 
- Quarto websites
- Quarto books


# Troubleshooting

## My code blocks aren't appearing in the appendix. What should I do?

First, verify that:

1. The extension is installed in `_extensions/coatless-quarto/regurgitate/`
2. The filter is listed in your YAML header: `filters: [regurgitate]`
3. Your code blocks have language identifiers (e.g., ` ```python`)

If issues persist, enable debug mode:

```yaml
extensions:
  regurgitate:
    debug: true
```

This will show detailed logging to help diagnose the issue.
