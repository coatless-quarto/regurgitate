## Introduction

This document demonstrates the `regurgitate` extension with `show-code-inline: false`. Code blocks are removed from their original positions and only appear at the end, organized by language.

## Python Example

Here's some Python code (it won't appear here, but will be in the appendix):

```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, world!")
    
hello()
```

Notice: No code is displayed above this line.

## Data Analysis

Let's do some calculations (again, code moved to appendix):

```r
# R code
data <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
mean(data)
```

## Shell Commands

Some bash commands (also in appendix only):

```bash
echo "Building project..."
make clean
make all
```

## More Python

Another Python snippet:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(arr.mean())
```

## JavaScript Example

A quick JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Conclusion

This document contains no inline code blocks. All code has been moved to the Code Appendix at the end, organized by programming language.
